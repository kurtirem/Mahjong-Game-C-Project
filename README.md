# Project Name Mahjong Solitaire

Implement a Mahjong solitaire game. The user interface should be done with QML,
the rest of the game logic with C++.

Basic features

These features are the minimum requirements for this project:

2D graphics showing the block board/pile

Generation of the block board/pile and functional gameplay, allowing the user to
select and remove open pairs of tiles, preventing them from removing tiles that
aren’t open

Additional features

Implement some of these for better project grade.

Consider implementing a block shuffle to help players when they get stuck (note
that it’s completely unnecessary to implement any attempt to generate a solvable
layout, so not all games can be completed, and that’s fine)

Advanced features

Using QtMultimedia for sounds

QtQuick3D for 3D effects in the UI.

Resources

opengameart.org offers royalty free graphics, e.g. for mahjong tiles.
