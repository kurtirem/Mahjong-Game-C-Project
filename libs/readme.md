README - libs Directory

This directory is intended for external libraries needed by the Mahjong Solitaire project. 

Current Status

No Additional External Libraries Used

Our Mahjong Solitaire project primarily uses Qt modules (QtQuick, QtMultimedia, etc.) provided by the standard Qt installation. Qt is not placed here due to its size and you must have Qt installed on your system separately.

At this point, the project does not depend on any additional third-party libraries that need to be bundled. All required graphics and sounds have been included as local resources, and no other external dependencies have been introduced.
